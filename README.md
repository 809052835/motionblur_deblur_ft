# motionblur_deblur_ft
Deblurring images with motion blur using Fourier Transform (Use Jupyter to run) - 
 The main language utilized for this project is python and different python libraries (such as numpy, matplotlib, skimage, and PIL) are included to achieve the desired outcome. 
The Ô¨Årst step is to convert the image to a gray-scale image (to eliminate the blur from a color image, the following steps should be applied to all the color channels). The next steps are applying Fourier transform in the image, convoluting the Fourier transformed image with a motion blur function, and adding noise to it. Last step is to de-convolute this output using Wiener method.
